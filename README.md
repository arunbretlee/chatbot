# Healthcare Chatbot

## Project Description
The Healthcare Chatbot is an intelligent, AI-powered assistant designed to enhance accessibility to healthcare information and streamline the process of finding and booking medical services. This chatbot aims to serve as a primary point of contact for users seeking quick answers to basic medical queries, assistance in locating nearby hospitals, and simplified scheduling of appointments with healthcare providers. Built with Python and leveraging Machine Learning, it provides a user-friendly interface to navigate common healthcare needs.

## Features
* **Basic Medical Queries:** Provides instant answers to common health-related questions using its AI knowledge base.
* **Hospital Locator:** Helps users find nearby hospitals and clinics based on their location.
* **Appointment Scheduling:** Facilitates the booking of appointments with healthcare providers, integrating with potential scheduling systems.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed for ease of use, ensuring a smooth and intuitive interaction experience.

## Technologies Used
* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Machine Learning:** Utilizes various ML techniques for natural language understanding (NLU) and response generation (specific libraries like NLTK, spaCy, scikit-learn, or TensorFlow/PyTorch can be added here if you've used them).
* **(Add any specific Python ML libraries here, e.g., NLTK, spaCy, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn)**
* **(Add any other relevant libraries or frameworks, e.g., Flask/Django for web interface, a specific database)**

## Installation

To set up the Healthcare Chatbot on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/healthcare-chatbot.git](https://github.com/your-username/healthcare-chatbot.git)
    cd healthcare-chatbot
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(You will need to create a `requirements.txt` file in your project containing all the Python libraries your project depends on. You can generate it using `pip freeze > requirements.txt` once your environment is set up.)*

4.  **Set up environment variables (if applicable):**
    *(e.g., API keys for hospital location services, database connection strings. You might use a `.env` file and `python-dotenv`.)*
    ```
    # Example .env content
    # API_KEY_MAPS=your_Maps_api_key
    ```

5.  **Prepare your ML models and data:**
    *(Briefly describe any steps needed to download pre-trained models, train your own models, or set up a knowledge base. E.g., "Download NLTK data:", "Train custom intent models:")*

## Usage

Once installed, you can run the chatbot from your terminal:

```bash
python main.py  # Or whatever your main entry file is called
